## Script

### HOOK (0-10 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Bold text animation - "$163 BILLION"]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**
> "One hundred sixty-three billion dollars."

**[VISUAL: Text reveals - "Lost annually to invisible supply chain trade-offs"]**

> "That's what manufacturing loses every year to decisions they can't see."

---

### STAKES (10-30 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Sales/Operations/Finance icons with conflicting arrows]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Here's the problem: Sales optimizes service. Operations optimizes cost. Finance optimizes cash."

**[VISUAL: Arrows collide in center with "?" icon]**

> "But no one owns the trade-offs between them."

**[VISUAL: Executive at desk, frustrated, surrounded by spreadsheets]**

> "So when the CFO asks, 'Why did ROCE drop last quarter?'..."

**[VISUAL: Clock animation - "2 WEEKS LATER"]**

> "...the answer takes two weeks and five spreadsheets."

### SOLUTION (30-70 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard reveal - Strategy Simulator interface]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "What if you could see it instantly?"

**[VISUAL: Click on "PORT STRIKE" scenario - metrics update in real-time]**

> "The Causal Chain Strategy Simulator connects every supply chain lever to your financial outcomes."

**[VISUAL: Zoom into Trade-Off Triangle - SERVICE/COST/CASH corners]**

> "One click shows the trade-off: Service improved by two percent—but it cost you one percent in margin and four days of cash."

**[VISUAL: Sankey diagram animates - Forecast Error → Safety Stock → ROCE]**

> "Click any metric to trace its cause. Forecast error drove safety stock up, which dragged ROCE down."

**[VISUAL: ROCE Sensitivity Calculator - slider adjusts, gauge moves]**

> "CFOs can simulate changes in real-time. 'What if we reduce safety stock by 15%?' Answer: $2 million freed, ROCE up 120 basis points."

**[VISUAL: AI Assistant query - "Why did ROCE drop despite OEE improvement?"]**

> "And when you need deeper context, ask in plain English. Snowflake Cortex AI explains the why."

**[VISUAL: AI response appears with financial insight]**

**[VISUAL: Snowflake logo + "Causal Chain Strategy Simulator"]**

**[VISUAL: QR code + URL - "snowflake.com/causal-chain-demo"]**

> "See the Strategy Simulator in action. Request a demo at snowflake.com/causal-chain-demo."

**[VISUAL: Final frame - Snowflake logo + tagline "Supply Chain. Visible."]**
